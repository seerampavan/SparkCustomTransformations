Special studies report for MSI testing by IHC - Block A7:

MLH1 IHC:  Present
MSH2 IHC:  Present
MSH6 IHC:  Present
PMS2 IHC:  Present

MMR Interpretation:  NORMAL.  It indicates that this tumor has probable microsatellite stability (MSS/normal MMR proteins - see comment).

Comment:  Immunohistochemical stains for the 4 main mismatch repair (MMR) proteins have been used as a surrogate marker for microsatellite instability.  The presence or absence of immunohistochemical staining in the mismatch repair proteins correlates well with microsatellite instability by PCR.

This interpretation may not apply to cancers other than colon cancers.  Genetic counseling is recommended for appropriate interpretation of all results.

12,22,PS-83,Gross Description,"
A.  SIGMOID WITH ADHERING SMALL BOWEL
Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name  [[PHI]]  and designated as ""sigmoid with adhering small bowel""
Description:  The specimen consists of an en bloc resection of a portion of colon having an attached portion of small intestine and suspected omental fat having overall dimensions of 10.5 x 7.0 x 6.0 cm.  The specimen has not been opened prior to its receipt in pathology.  The colonic component has a length of 8.0 cm, and a diameter varying from 4.0-5.5 cm.  It reveals a stapled margin of resection, upon which is a suture, identifying the distal end, per the requisition form.  At the central aspect is a 4.5 cm piece of firmly fibrotically adherent, apparently tangentially resected small intestinal tissue.  The proximal aspect reveals an adherent 4.5 x 3.0 x 2.5 cm piece of omental fat presumably covering fibrotically encapsulated surgical staples of a Hartman's pouch.  The serosa of the colonic component reveals adhesions and suspected tumor involvement.  
The site of serosal adhesions and presumed tumor is inked blue; the margin of resection of the adherent piece of omental fat is inked black.
The colonic component is opened to reveal a coarsely granular, fungating, exophytic tumor measuring 4.5 x 4.5 cm, which is sectioned to reveal a maximum radial thickness of 5.5 cm.  Staples are noted within the tumor, apparently representing extravasation of the tumor beyond the proximal stapled margin of the Hartman's pouch.  The tumor appears to violate the colonic wall, and to approximate the blue inked serosa of the colon by less than 0.1 cm.  Tumor appears to involve the inked serosa.  The tumor most closely approximates the distal colonic margin of resection by 3.5 cm, and the mesenteric radial margin of resection by 0.5 cm.  The colonic wall varies in thickness from 0.1-0.5 cm, and the remaining mucosa is effaced.
The adherent piece of small intestinal tissue reveals a stapled margin of resection, and is tightly fibrotically adherent to the colonic component.  Tumor appears to involve, but not violate the wall of the small intestinal component.  Its wall measures 0.3 cm in thickness, and its mucosa appears unremarkable, with no recognizable tumor involvement.
A complete lymph node search is performed, resulting in 12 suspected lymph nodes, which are submitted in their entirety.

30,25,ES-87,Microscopic Description,"
LEFT BREAST AT 6:00, 3 CM FROM NIPPLE:  There are two core biopsies, each positive for an infiltrating carcinoma.  The haphazardly arranged infiltrating cords of neoplastic cuboidal epithelia have a nuclear grade 2, histologic grade 3, and mitotic index 1.  The tumor infiltrates fibroblastic response and fibrotic tissue.  There is sparse mature fat, which has infiltrative neoplasm.  The tumor spans at least 1.4cm in A1, but may be larger clinically or radiographically. Normal breast lobules and ducts are not seen.  Neither vascular nor lymphatic invasion is demonstrable.  Calcifications are rare in the desmoplastic stroma.  A sparse lymphocytic response is apparent.  At one pole in each biopsy, there are some rare dilated benign ductules lined by a bilayer of benign cells.  Elsewhere in the bulk of the neoplasm, there is a rare proliferative duct with partially dislodged epithelia in the lumen.  The latter is suspicious for an intermediate-grade ductal carcinoma in situ without necrosis, for which CK5/6 is performed.  The tag of blue ink is confirmed on the biopsy.

IMMUNOPEROXIDASE STAINS:  
A battery of immunoperoxidase stains is performed on block A2.  The results show that the invasive carcinoma is strongly positive with E-cadherin, favoring a ductal type.  The focus suspicious for ductal carcinoma in situ shows a mixed pattern.  In the largest duct however, most of the cells are negative with the CK5/6 whereas, in the smaller duct, there is increased positivity.  Therefore, the larger duct is presumed to be a single intermediate grade DCIS and the smaller duct is presumed to be a usual ductal epithelial hyperplasia.  The invasive component is negative with P63 and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, whereas the DCIS component has myoepithelial cells highlighted with these stains.  

The invasive carcinoma is strongly positive with estrogen receptor (96%).  The progesterone receptor is strongly positive (90%).  The proliferative index is measured by MIB-1 immunoperoxidase stain is increased slightly above 20% nuclear staining.

A)  SENTINEL NODES LEFT SIDE:  Received in formalin, labeled [[PHI]], are two fragments of adipose tissue that aggregate to 3.0 x 2.5 x 1.2 cm.  The adipose tissue is dissected to reveal four lymph nodes that range in size from 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm to 1.0 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm.

SECTIONS:
A1)-A2)  two nodes in each cassette with one node in each cassette inked black.

B)  LEFT BREAST TISSUE:  Received in formalin, labeled [[PHI]], is a simple mastectomy specimen with a weight of 397 g.  The specimen measures 25.0 cm from medial to lateral, 15.0 cm from superior to inferior, and 4.0 cm from anterior to posterior.  The anterior aspect is partially surfaced by a skin ellipse, 20.0 x 6.0 cm.  There is an eccentrically located areola with a rim measurement of 1.2 cm.  The nipple is flush with the skin surface and measures 1.0 cm in greatest dimension.  The specimen is oriented with a suture on the lateral aspect.

The specimen is inked as follows:
superoanterior - orange
inferoanterior - green
posterior - black

The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a gray-white, stellate mass that is located in the lower inner quadrant and measures 2.4 cm from medial to lateral, 2.6 cm from superior to inferior, and 1.5 cm from anterior to posterior.  The mass comes within 0.8 cm from the inferior margin, 0.8 cm from the posterior margin, and 4.0 cm from the superior margin.  Surrounding the mass is a large amount of nodular fibrous tissue with multiple blue dome cysts.  This area measures 5.0 cm from medial to lateral, 9.0 cm from superior to inferior, and 5.0 cm from anterior to posterior.  The area focally abuts the superior margin and comes within 3 cm from the inferior margin and 1 cm from the posterior margin.  The area abuts the previously described mass.  The nodular area is palpated to reveal a large amount of pasty material exuding from ducts.  The area occupies the subareolar region.  The remainder of the cut surfaces reveal yellow, lobulated adipose tissue with approximately 10% gray-white, fibrous tissue.  The upper outer quadrant is palpated and no lymph nodes are noted.

Multiple fragments of adipose tissue are noted within the container that aggregate to 2.5 x 2.5 x 1.0 cm.  The adipose tissue palpated and no lymph nodes are noted.

BREAST, RIGHT, 10:00, 6 CM FROM NIPPLE, ULTRASOUND GUIDED CORE BIOPSY:

-Ductal carcinoma in situ, intermediate grade and fragments of papillary carcinoma, suspicious for invasive carcinoma (see comment)

Comment: All the cores show areas of papillary carcinoma. Areas surrounded by myoepithelial cells with myoepithelial cell markers (p63 and SMMHC) are present, consistent with DCIS, papillary type.  However, in some of the fragments are detached or only minimal adjacent stroma is present for evaluation, and in these areas a definitive myoepithelial cell layer cannot be definitively identified.  Therefore the findings are consistent with DCIS and fragments of papillary carcinoma, suspicious for invasion, however evaluation of the entire lesion is needed for a definitive classification.  The areas of DCIS and papillary carcinoma show intermediate nuclear grade, necrosis is not identified, the largest area of carcinoma on a single fragment is 10 mm.  Microcalcifications are not identified. ER and PR immunostains will be ordered and reported in an addendum, if a definitive invasive component is identified in an excision specimen a complete breast panel will be performed.

-Intraductal papilloma with lobular intraepithelial neoplasia (LCIS) and atypical ductal hyperplasia)
-Lobular intraepithelial neoplasia (lobular carcinoma in situ), classic type, extensive

Comment: Two lesions are identified grossly and localized with a wire.  The lesion associated with the previous biopsy site and marking clip is characterized by a papillary carcinoma.  Immunohistochemical stains for myoepithelial markers were performed (p63 and SMMHC) in multiple blocks and the majority of the lesion is surrounded by a layer of myoepithelial cells, therefore consistent with intraductal papillary carcinoma (DCIS papillary type).  In block C10 a 3 mm area showing absence of a myoepithelial cell layer is identified adjacent to the papillary carcinoma, consistent with a focus of invasive ductal carcinoma.  In addition areas characterized by nests of neoplastic cells adjacent to the areas of capillary DCIS lacking a definitive myoepithelial cell layer are identified, consistent with foci of microinvasion (less than 1 mm).  The second lesion identified shows an intraductal papilloma with areas of LIN (LCIS and ADH).  E-cadherin immunostain supports the presence of extensive LIN (LCIS).

COMMENT: The tumor is adenocarcinoma of mixed subtypes.  The predominant component is solid pattern with central necrosis and intratumoral neutrophils (60%).  The second component is cribriform pattern (20%),  micropapillary pattern (10%) and acinar pattern (10%).  Tumor cells are separated by fibrous bands infiltrated by lymphocytes.

The previous right lower lobectomy specimen  (SV08-20876, 11/3/2008) is reviewed.  The tumor cells are arranged in acinar (70%) and papillary (30%)  patterns with focal  mucinous features.  The tumor cells are back-to-back with patchy pockets of chronic lymphocytic infiltrate.  Although both tumors are adenocarcinoma, they are not identical.

The immunohistochemical profile of the tumor is as follows:  CK7 positive, CK20 negative, napsin-A negative, TTF-1 negative, ER negative, and CDX-2 negative.  The CK7-positive and CK20-negative status of the tumor supports a diagnosis of pulmonary origin.  The adenocarcinoma of the lung from 2008 (SV08-20876) was compared with the current tumor and the morphologic appearance is identical.

HER2 gene status (Ventana Medical Systems [Ventana] INFORM HER2 Dual ISH DNA Probe Cocktail) is reported as a function of the ratio of the average number of HER2 gene copies to the average number of Chr17 copies in nuclei of cells within an invasive breast carcinoma.  HER2 gene status is classified as non-amplified (HER2/Chr17 ratio < 2.0) or amplified (HER2/Chr17 ratio  2.0).  The method of scoring is based on 2013 ASCO/CAP Recommendations for HER2 Testing in Breast Cancer.

Methods:  HER2 (ERBB2) gene amplification was assessed utilizing the FDA approved Ventana HER2 INFORM Dual ISH DNA Probe Cocktail using two color chromogenic in situ in hybridization (ISH).  At least twenty non-overlapping nuclei containing at least one silver black (HER2) and one red (Chr17) signal were enumerated.  The ratio of black signals (HER2) to red signals (Chr17) was calculated. HER2 gene status (Ventana Medical Systems (Ventana) INFORM HER2 Dual ISH DNA Probe Cocktail) was reported as a function of the ratio of the average number of HER2 gene copies to the average number of Chr17 copies in nuclei of cells within an invasive breast carcinoma.  HER2 gene status was then classified as non-amplified (HER2/Chr17 ratio < 2.0) or amplified (HER2/Chr17 ratio  2.0).Immunohistochemistry was performed using sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue and multmer diaminobenzidine (DAB) based system on a Ventana BenchMark XT/Ultra automated slide stainer.  Whenapplicablethe immunohistochemistry was quantified using a Leica SCN-400 digital whole slide scanning system and the Definiens Architect/Tissue Studio image analysis software.  All digital image analysis results were reviewed and correlated with the morphological findings by a board certified pathologist.

The test has been developed, validated, performed, and its performance characteristics determined by Providence Portland Regional Laboratory in Portland OR. Except for HER2 gene amplification detection by Dual ISH, ER, PR detection system, other reagentshave not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary.  The test is for clinical purposes.  It should not be regarded as investigational or for research.

B.  DESIGNATED ""LEFT BREAST TISSUE"":  A keratin 5/6 immunoperoxidase stain is performed on block B8.  The solitary duct of concern is negative with this stain, indicative of atypical ductal epithelial hyperplasia.  The control slide worked.  Levels through that block were obtained; however, the focus disappears readily and cannot be further evaluated.

F.  DESIGNATED ""RIGHT BREAST TISSUE"", NIPPLE-SPARING MASTECTOMY:  A CK5/6 keratin stain is performed on block F5.  The DCIS shows absence of keratin 5/6 staining, supporting the diagnosis of a DCIS component which is within 0.5 mm of the black-inked posterior margin.

Also, deeper levels through the block were obtained to get more complete cross sections of the inked margins.  Invasive carcinoma is within 0.4 cm of the orange-inked superior-anterior margin and is 0.5 cm from the green-inked inferior-anterior margin.  The solid DCIS component is 0.5 cm from the green-inked inferior-anterior margin.  The posterior black-inked margin is still negative for carcinoma.  The invasive carcinoma is associated with some reactive fibrosis presumed to be a prior biopsy site.

Appropriate controls were used for each immunohistochemical stain.  This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the Providence Oregon Regional Laboratory and Pathology Services, 4400 NE Halsey Street, Bldg. 3, Portland, OR, 97213, CLIA #38D2032720.  It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary.  This test is used for clinical purposes.  It should not be regarded as investigational or for research.  This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing.

HER2 gene status is classified as non-amplified (HER2/Chr17 ratio < 2.0) or amplified (HER2/Chr17 ratio  2.0).

Methods:  HER2 (ERBB2) gene amplification was assessed utilizing the FDA approved Ventana HER2 INFORM Dual ISH DNA Probe Cocktail using two color chromogenic in situ in hybridization (ISH).  At least twenty non-overlapping nuclei containing at least one silver black (HER2) and one red (Chr17) signal were enumerated.  The ratio of black signals (HER2) to red signals (Chr17) was calculated. HER2 gene status (Ventana Medical Systems (Ventana) INFORM HER2 Dual ISH DNA Probe Cocktail) was reported as a function of the ratio of the average number of HER2 gene copies to the average number of Chr17 copies in nuclei of cells within an invasive breast carcinoma.  HER2 gene status was then classified as non-amplified (HER2/Chr17 ratio < 2.0) or amplified (HER2/Chr17 ratio  2.0).Immunohistochemistry was performed using sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue and multmer diaminobenzidine (DAB) based system on a Ventana BenchMark XT/Ultra automated slide stainer.  Whenapplicablethe immunohistochemistry was quantified using a Leica SCN-400 digital whole slide scanning system and the Definiens Architect/Tissue Studio image analysis software.  All digital image analysis results were reviewed and correlated with the morphological findings by a board certified pathologist.

The test has been developed, validated, performed, and its performance characteristics determined by Providence Portland Regional Laboratory in Portland OR. Except for HER2 gene amplification detection by Dual ISH, ER, PR detection system, other reagentshave not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary.  The test is for clinical purposes.  It should not be regarded as investigational or for research.  This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing.

116,31,BM-108,Addendum,"
This addendum is issued to report the cytogenetics and FISH results.

NeoGenomics Laboratories, 5 Jenner Street, Suite 100, Irvine, California, Cytogenetics Analysis (1418212/CYG17-058872)

Karyotype:  46,XY[12]
Interpretation:  MALE KARYOTYPE – SEE COMMENT

Cytogenetic analysis shows a male karyotype in all cells analyzed.

PLEASE NOTE: Due to poor mitotic index, only twelve metaphase cells are available for analysis.  This is less than our standard of twenty cells and therefore represents an incomplete study and a disease-associated change cannot be ruled out.

Comments:
Standard cytogenetic analysis may not detect subtle submicroscopic rearrangements and may not include metaphases from abnormal cell populations with low mitotic rates or present in low levels.

NeoGenomics Laboratories, 5 Jenner Street, Suite 100, Irvine, California, FISH Analysis (1418212/FST17-070019)

Results:  MDS Standard FISH Analysis - Normal *

118,31,BM-108,Diagnosis,"
PERIPHERAL BLOOD:

- Pancytopenia with scattered reactive lymphocytes and monocytes
- No evidence of overtly dysplastic granulocytes, immature monocytes or circulating blasts

BONE MARROW, RIGHT SIDE, ASPIRATE, CLOT AND CORE BIOPSY:

- Cellular bone marrow aspirate smears showing active myelopoiesis and erythropoiesis with megaloblastoid erythroid maturation, adequate megakaryocytes, and less than 2% blasts
- Bone marrow core biopsy reveals subcortical hypocellular bone marrow with distortion of trabecular bone, extensive hemorrhage and absence of hematopoietic cellular elements, suboptimal for evaluation of metastatic carcinoma (see comment)
- Increased iron storage, negative for ringed sideroblasts
- The concurrent flow cytometry analysis reveals no increased immature myeloid cells or monocytes in the no significant immunophenotypic abnormalities in lymphoid cells (see FL-17-1738)

Comment:  The bone marrow aspirate smears are cellular and adequate for evaluation. No clusters of metastatic carcinoma cells are seen in the aspirate smears.  No good morphologic evidence of high-grade myelodysplasia is identified. However, the bone marrow core biopsy sections are suboptimal for evaluation, which show only small fragments of subcortical hypocellular marrow with distortion of trabecular bone, extensive hemorrhage, but without hematopoietic cellular elements.  The bone marrow clot section contains predominantly peripheral blood cellular elements without bone marrow spicules.  Therefore, the evaluation of metastatic tumor is hampered in the core biopsy tissue despite that no evidence of metastatic carcinoma is noted on multiple level sections of bone marrow core biopsy and the immunostain for keratin AE1/AE3. If clinically or radiographically indicated, repeating of bone marrow biopsy with representative lesional tissue may be recommended to exclude the possibility of metastatic carcinoma. Clinical and cytogenetic correlation is also needed to exclude the possibility of morphologically subtle low grade myelodysplasia.  

This case was also reviewed by Dr. Yibin Zhang, hematopathologist, who concurs with the interpretation.

PARAFFIN IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY (block A1):

CD34 -- negative
CD117 -- negative
Keratin AE1 AE3 -- negative for metastatic carcinoma

FLOW CYTOMETRY (FL-17-1738):  The flow cytometry analysis gated events immature cells (less than 2% of total analyzed events) reveals no increased immature myeloid cells or monocytes.  Flow cytometry analysis gated on the lymphoid cells (41% of total analyzed events) reveals the majority of lymphoid cells to be phenotypically normal T-cells without aberrant antigen expression or loss.  The CD4/CD8 ratio is within normal range.  The B-cells are not increased.  No monotypic B-cell population or abnormal coexpression of CD19/CD5 or CD19/CD10 is detected.  The immunophenotypical data do not suggest high-grade myelodysplasia or marrow involvement by non-Hodgkin lymphoma. 

Disclaimer:  The above immunohistochemical stains are necessary in conjunction with flow cytometry results to establish the diagnosis.  Flow cytometry analyzes a suspension of the cells for the phenotyping of single cells and for clonality assessment.  The immunohistochemistry is applied for the analysis of cellular distribution patterns in a morphologic context.  Phenotyping/clonality by flow cytometry and cellular distribution pattern in a morphologic context by immunohistochemical stains together are essential to render a definitive and actionable diagnosis.

Appropriate controls were used for each immunohistochemical stain.

NeoGenomics Laboratories, 5 Jenner Street, Suite 100, Irvine, California, FISH Analysis (870833/FST16-042319, block A1)

Results:  ROS1 FISH Analysis - Negative *

Interpretation:
Interphase FISH analysis was performed using a ROS1 Break Apart FISH Probe.  A ROS1 gene rearrangement was not observed.  However, an abnormal signal pattern of one fusion (1F) was seen in 46% of nuclei scored, which is above our cut-off value of 39% and suggests a deletion or monosomy of chromosome 6.  Since the possibility of sectioning artifact cannot be excluded, the clinical significance
of this result in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is uncertain.  Monosomy or deletion of the ROS1 locus is not currently an indication for crizotinib therapy.

Results:  ROS1 FISH Analysis – Normal*

Interpretation:  Interphase FISH analysis was performed using a ROS1 Break Apart FISH Probe.  FISH probe signals were within the normal reference range.  A ROS1 gene rearrangement was not observed in the nuclei scored.  This represents a NORMAL result and suggests that ROS1 inhibitors are not indicated.

ADDENDUM:

Providence Regional Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory, 4400 NE Halsey St., Building 3, Portland, OR, Molecular Analysis:

EGFR Mutation - Not Detected

Interpretive Information:  Determining EGFR mutation status is helpful in identifying patient eligibility for tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. Specific oncogenic EGFR mutations in pulmonary adenocarcinomas are associated with clinical response or resistance to the TKIs gefitinib (Iressa) and erlotinib (Tarceva). Clinical response has been associated with deletions in EGFR exon 19 and point mutations in codons 719 (exon 18), 768 (exon 20), 858 (exon 21) and 861 (exon 21). Clinical resistance to TKI therapy has been associated with the T790M mutation in exon 20, as either a primary or secondary mutation.

KRAS Codon 12/13 Mutation - Not Detected
KRAS Codon 61 Mutation - Not Detected

Interpretive Information:  Oncogenic KRAS mutations have been linked with resistance to anti-EGFR therapies. Thus, determination of mutation status is useful in determining patient eligibility for this treatment.

Results:  Negative for ALK rearrangement, polysomy 2 present

Interpretation:  Interphase FISH analysis was performed using the ALK Break Apart FISH Probe Kit. An ALK gene rearrangement was observed in 2% of the nuclei scored but is below the cut-off for this assay.  However, an abnormal signal pattern of > or = 3 fusions (> or = 3F) was seen in 20% of nuclei scored. This finding is at or above our cutoff value of 36% and suggests ALK gene amplification or polysomy of chromosome 2.  The clinical significance of ALK gene amplification or chromosome 2 polysomy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is uncertain.  Polysomy is not currently an indication for crizotinib therapy.

*Comment:  The technical component of this test was completed at NeoGenomics, 5 Jenner Street, Suite 100, Irvine, California;  all controls were within expected ranges.

Please see complete scanned results in the patient's electronic medical record.

ROS1 will be ordered and reported at a later date.

The above tests are performed per Dr. Sanborn request.

Comment:  Immunohistochemical stains for the 4 main mismatch repair (MMR) proteins have been used as a surrogate marker for microsatellite instability.  The presence or absence of immunohistochemical staining in the mismatch repair proteins correlates well with microsatellite instability by PCR.

This interpretation may not apply to cancers other than colon cancers.  Genetic counseling is recommended for appropriate interpretation of all results.

--------------------------------end of addendum--------------------------

ADDENDUM 01/31/12:

As mentioned in the original report, a panel of immunostains is performed.  The tumor cells are positive for mammaglobin and focally positive for BRST-2.  An e-cadherin stain is also positive.  Cytokeratin 7 is positive; cytokeratin 20 is negative.  Pankeratin (AE1/AE3) is positive.  All of these markers are consistent with primary mammary carcinoma, and ductal carcinoma specifically.

Estrogen and progesterone receptor stains are both negative.

Mib-1 and HER-2/neu studies are pending. 

As mentioned in the initial microscopic description, the morphologic features are suggestive of apocrine differentiation.  The Nottingham grade is 2 (tubules - 3; nuclear atypia - 3; mitotic activity - 1; score 7/9).  This tumor is poorly differentiated morphologically, but by criteria, the mitotic count amounts to one point and the resulting grade of 2. 

AMENDED DIAGNOSIS

A)  LEFT BREAST, 10:00, 1 CM FROM NIPPLE, CORE BIOPSY:

1.  Invasive duct carcinoma, Nottingham grade 2.
2.  Tumor involves three of three cores and largest measurable span of tumor is 1.4 cm. 

B)  LEFT AXILLA, BIOPSY:

1.  Invasive ductal carcinoma, possibly metastatic to a lymph node.

COMMENT:  As mentioned above, HER-2/neu and mib-1 studies are pending.  This tumor display cells with large nuclei and quite prominent nucleoli, as well as abundant surrounding eosinophilic cytoplasm suggesting apocrine differentiation.  Dr. Maritza Martel, breast and OB/GYN pathologist, has also reviewed this case and agrees.

A.  LEFT SENTINEL NODE BIOPSY

- One benign lymph node (0/1, see comment)

B.  LEFT BREAST, SIMPLE MASTECTOMY

- Scattered small foci of invasive ductal carcinoma, Nottingham grade 2, measuring up to 1.6 mm associated with extensive high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ with comedo necrosis 
- DICS spans an area measuring 4.5 cm (see comment and staging summary)
- Surgical margins free of involvement by invasive and in situ carcinoma (see staging summary

Comment:  This patient's previous history of invasive carcinoma with metastasis to the left axilla is noted (see previous case WS12-4069).  Within the current mastectomy specimen there is a relatively large area involved by high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ measuring 4.5 x 4.0 cm with stromal changes consistent with treatment effect within the background.  Only a few small foci of invasive carcinoma are identified measuring up to 1.6 mm.  The sampled lymph node appears benign but also shows focal stromal fibrosis suggestive of treatment effect.  These findings are outlined in the following staging summary.

Comment:  Immunohistochemical studies on the tumor show it to be focally positive for CDX2 and rarely positive for CK20.  It is negative for CK7, TTF-1 synaptophysin, chromogranin and p40.  This tends to exclude neuroendocrine and squamous differentiation, as well as pulmonary origin.  Together with the clinical, endoscopic and radiographic studies, this staining pattern supports colorectal origin.

BRAF V600E Mutation - Detected

Interpretive Information:  Activating mutations of the proto-oncogene BRAF occur in many human cancers, including malignant melanoma, colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, and thyroid cancer. Interpretation of BRAF test results depends on the tissue tested (colorectal carcinoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma, melanoma or other tumors). The majority of BRAF mutations in melanoma and other tumors occur in the BRAF codon 600 site in exon 15 and may be identified as BRAF c.1799T>A, p.Val600Glu (V600E).

Since the mutation has been detected, this colon cancer is more likely sporadic, and unlikely to be due to HNPCC.

Please see complete scanned report in the patient's electronic medical record.

ADDENDUM:

Special studies report for MSI testing by IHC - Block A2:

MLH1 IHC  - Absent
MSH2 IHC  - Present
MSH6 IHC  - Present
PMS2 IHC  - Absent

MMR Interpretation:  ABNORMAL.  The results indicate that this tumor has high microsatellite instability (MSI-H/MMR protein deficiency - see comment).

Comment:  Immunohistochemical stains for the 4 main mismatch repair (MMR) proteins have been used as a surrogate marker for microsatellite instability.  The presence or absence of immunohistochemical staining in the mismatch repair proteins correlates well with microsatellite instability by PCR.

The absence of MLH1 and PMS2 is the most common pattern of loss.  Both sporadic and hereditary tumors may show this pattern, but most are sporadic.  The MLH1 loss may be due to sporadic hypermethylation of the MLH1 promoter, or it could be due to a mutation in MLH1.  Thus, MLH1 loss requires further evaluation, including genetics counseling.  A BRAF V600E mutation test has been ordered and will be issued as an addendum.  

This interpretation may not apply to cancers other than colon cancers.  Genetic counseling is recommended for appropriate interpretation of all results.  Dr. Yaping Wu has also reviewed the MMR slides.

RIGHT COLON, COLECTOMY:

- Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, with medullary features (see comment)
- Tumor is present in ascending colon and measures 7.3 x 4.8 x 2.5 cm
- Tumor invades through the muscularis into pericolonic adipose tissue
- Focal lymphovascular invasion identified
- Surgical resection margins negative for tumor
- One out of thirty one lymph nodes positive for metastatic carcinoma (1/31)
- Appendix negative for tumor
- Non-neoplastic colonic mucosa showing focal reactive hyperplastic changes

Comment:  The previous biopsy tissue was concurrently reviewed (WS-13-43058).  The resected tumor demonstrates same morphology to that seen in the biopsy specimen, consistent with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.  By immunohistochemistry, CD31 and p40 stains highlight angiolymphatic spaces, some containing tumor clusters, confirming lymphovascular invasion.  Keratin AE1/AE3 stain is positive in one of the lymph nodes containing scattered single tumor cells, confirming metastasis.

212,39,ES-131,Gross Description,"
A)  LEFT BREAST MASTECTOMY:  Received in formalin, labeled [[PHI]], is a 565 gram simple mastectomy specimen with a suture at the medial aspect.  The specimen measures from medial to lateral 23 cm, inferior to superior 23 cm, anterior to posterior 7 cm.  On the anterior surface is a 17 x 4.5 cm ellipse of gray-tan skin with an eccentrically flattened nipple surrounding unremarkable areola.  A marked amount of localizing blue dye is previously injected into the specimen.  The skin surface is otherwise unremarkable.  The margins are marked as follows: anterior superior - orange, inferior anterior - green, lateral - yellow, deep - black.  The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral.

The random lateral skin and the deep surgical margin in slide A3 are negative for neoplasm.  Slide A4 demonstrates a biopsy site with an adjacent infiltrating ductal carcinoma with histologic grade 3, nuclear grade 3 and mitotic index 2 for a total Nottingham combined histologic score 3 (8/9) in  gross lesion #1.  
The deep margin from the first-described lesion is negative for neoplasm.  The first-described lesion in slides A6 and A7 is negative for neoplasm, showing abundant stromal fibrosis.  In slide A8, there is a minute contaminant of neoplasm, which is not embedded in the stroma.  However, the section demonstrates no evidence of carcinoma.  The additional sections of the second-described lesion show stromal fibrosis and a rare minute calcification.  There is mild benign fibrocystic disease and focal columnar cell change in slide A10.

The third-described lesion shows an invasive ductal carcinoma, histologic grade 3, nuclear grade 3, mitotic index 2, similar to that of the first-described lesion.  This is focally marginated by a patchy lymphocytic reaction.  Tumor spans 1.0 cm in slide A12, 1.1 cm in slide A13, and there is a smaller remnant of invasive carcinoma in slide A14, adjacent to some fat necrosis.  The closest deep margin to the invasive component is in slide A13, located 2.5 mm from the deep margin.  The random four quadrants of breast tissue show atrophic breast tissue, fibrocystic disease, vascular calcifications and no evidence of neoplasm.

IMMUNOPEROXIDASE STAIN RESULTS:  A smooth muscle myosin heavy chain and p63 are performed on block A4.  The results show that the invasive component is the major component of the neoplasm with a span of 6 mm by 4.5 mm.  The DCIS component comprises less than 10% of the tumor.  The invasive component lacks myoepithelial cells, as demonstrated with the lack of nuclear staining with p63 and immunoperoxidase staining with the smooth muscle myosin heavy chain.  The DCIS component is appropriately positive for myoepithelia with these stains.
B)  SENTINEL NODE #1:  A solitary fat-replaced lymph node is negative for neoplasm on H&E and with cytokeratin immunoperoxidase stain (0/1).
C)  SENTINEL NODES #2 AND #3:  Two lymph nodes entirely submitted are fat-replaced and negative for neoplasm on H&E and cytokeratin stain (0/2).  Slide C3 represents the remnants of the larger lymph node, which is still negative for neoplasm.

HER2 gene status (Ventana Medical Systems [Ventana] INFORM HER2 Dual ISH DNA Probe Cocktail) is reported as a function of the ratio of the average number of HER2 gene copies to the average number of Chr17 copies in nuclei of cells within an invasive breast carcinoma.  HER2 gene status is classified as non-amplified (HER2/Chr17 ratio < 2.0) or amplified (HER2/Chr17 ratio ? 2.0).  The method of scoring is based on 2013 ASCO/CAP Recommendations for HER2 Testing in Breast Cancer.

HER2 Gene Amplification by Dual ISH: Positive for amplification of HER2 gene (HER2/Chr17 ratio ? 2.0 or average HER2 copy number ? 6.0 signals/cell) / Equivocal for amplification of HER2 gene (HER2/Chr17 < 2.0 and average HER2 copy number < 6.0 and ? 4.0 signals/cells / Negative for amplification of HER2 gene (HER2/Chr17 ratio < 2.0 and average HER2 copy number < 4.0 signals/cell)

Methods:  HER2 (ERBB2) gene amplification was assessed utilizing the FDA approved Ventana HER2 INFORM Dual ISH DNA Probe Cocktail using two color chromogenic in situ in hybridization (ISH).  At least twenty non-overlapping nuclei containing at least one silver black (HER2) and one red (Chr17) signal were enumerated.  The ratio of black signals (HER2) to red signals (Chr17) was calculated. HER2 gene status (Ventana Medical Systems (Ventana) INFORM HER2 Dual ISH DNA Probe Cocktail) was reported as a function of the ratio of the average number of HER2 gene copies to the average number of Chr17 copies in nuclei of cells within an invasive breast carcinoma.  HER2 gene status was then classified as non-amplified (HER2/Chr17 ratio < 2.0) or amplified (HER2/Chr17 ratio ? 2.0).Immunohistochemistry was performed using sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue and multmer diaminobenzidine (DAB) based system on a Ventana BenchMark XT/Ultra automated slide stainer.  Whenapplicablethe immunohistochemistry was quantified using a Leica SCN-400 digital whole slide scanning system and the Definiens Architect/Tissue Studio image analysis software.  All digital image analysis results were reviewed and correlated with the morphological findings by a board certified pathologist.

The test has been developed, validated, performed, and its performance characteristics determined by Providence Portland Regional Laboratory in Portland OR. Except for HER2 gene amplification detection by Dual ISH, ER, PR detection system, other reagentshave not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary.  The test is for clinical purposes.  It should not be regarded as investigational or for research.

A.  BREAST, LEFT, PARTIAL MASTECTOMY:

- Invasive ductal carcinoma, Nottingham combined histologic grade 1, and invasive lobular carcinoma, Nottingham combined histologic grade 2 (see comment).
- Invasive carcinoma measures 1.8 cm in greatest dimension (see comment).
- Invasive carcinoma 0.5 mm from posterior margin, 8 mm from inferior margin and greater than 1 cm removed from lateral, medial, anterior and superior margins.
- Minor component of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), intermediate grade, solid to cribriform type, associated with invasive carcinoma region.
- DCIS calculated to span approximately 2 cm in greatest dimension (see comment).
- DCIS 5 mm from inferior margin and does not come closer to remaining margins than that described for the invasive component.
- Calcifications associated with invasive carcinoma and benign breast tissue.
- Prior biopsy site changes associated with carcinoma region.
- Fibrocystic changes.
- Intraductal papilloma.
- Fat necrosis.
- Skin, uninvolved by malignancy.
COMMENT:  The part A specimen is serially sectioned into fifteen gross slices, with slice 1 being the lateral margin and slice 15 being the medial margin.  A single gross tumor is present involving gross slices 8 through 12.  This gross tumor measures 1.8 cm in greatest dimension.  Histologic sections show invasive carcinoma involving gross slices 8 through 12.  The predominant pattern in the invasive carcinoma is that of invasive ductal carcinoma, with a value of 2 for tubule formation, a value of 2 for nuclear pleomorphism and a value of 1 for mitotic rate, as well as diffusely positive staining for E-cadherin.  A less prominent and histologically different and distinct pattern of the invasive carcinoma, seen at the periphery of the tumor in some sections and measuring 6 mm in greatest dimension in a given section, is a component of invasive lobular carcinoma, with a value of 3 for tubule formation, a value of 2 for nuclear pleomorphism and a value of 1 for mitotic rate, as well as uniform absence of staining for E-cadherin.

DCIS involves sections from several gross slices, including sections from three consecutive gross slices out of fifteen total gross slices proceeding from lateral to medial.  Given that the overall lateral-to-medial dimension of the intact gross specimen measures 10 cm, this extent of DCIS is calculated to involve approximately 2 cm in greatest dimension in the gross specimen.

The prior left breast core biopsy from 11:00 4 cm from nipple (PS-16-15451) contained invasive ductal carcinoma, grade 1.  The prognostic breast marker results listed in the staging summary below are taken from the panel performed on the invasive ductal carcinoma in this prior biopsy specimen.  A tissue block from the current case (block A6), which contains components of both invasive ductal carcinoma and invasive lobular carcinoma, will be submitted for additional prognostic breast marker panel analysis.  Results of this additional study will follow in an addendum report.

HER2 gene status (Ventana Medical Systems [Ventana] INFORM HER2 Dual ISH DNA Probe Cocktail) is reported as a function of the ratio of the average number of HER2 gene copies to the average number of Chr17 copies in nuclei of cells within an invasive breast carcinoma.  HER2 gene status is classified as non-amplified (HER2/Chr17 ratio < 2.0) or amplified (HER2/Chr17 ratio ? 2.0).  The method of scoring is based on 2013 ASCO/CAP Recommendations for HER2 Testing in Breast Cancer.

HER2 Gene Amplification by Dual ISH: Positive for amplification of HER2 gene (HER2/Chr17 ratio ? 2.0 or average HER2 copy number ? 6.0 signals/cell) / Equivocal for amplification of HER2 gene (HER2/Chr17 < 2.0 and average HER2 copy number < 6.0 and ? 4.0 signals/cells / Negative for amplification of HER2 gene (HER2/Chr17 ratio < 2.0 and average HER2 copy number < 4.0 signals/cell)

Methods:  HER2 (ERBB2) gene amplification was assessed utilizing the FDA approved Ventana HER2 INFORM Dual ISH DNA Probe Cocktail using two color chromogenic in situ in hybridization (ISH).  At least twenty non-overlapping nuclei containing at least one silver black (HER2) and one red (Chr17) signal were enumerated.  The ratio of black signals (HER2) to red signals (Chr17) was calculated. HER2 gene status (Ventana Medical Systems (Ventana) INFORM HER2 Dual ISH DNA Probe Cocktail) was reported as a function of the ratio of the average number of HER2 gene copies to the average number of Chr17 copies in nuclei of cells within an invasive breast carcinoma.  HER2 gene status was then classified as non-amplified (HER2/Chr17 ratio < 2.0) or amplified (HER2/Chr17 ratio ? 2.0).Immunohistochemistry was performed using sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue and multmer diaminobenzidine (DAB) based system on a Ventana BenchMark XT/Ultra automated slide stainer.  Whenapplicablethe immunohistochemistry was quantified using a Leica SCN-400 digital whole slide scanning system and the Definiens Architect/Tissue Studio image analysis software.  All digital image analysis results were reviewed and correlated with the morphological findings by a board certified pathologist.

The test has been developed, validated, performed, and its performance characteristics determined by Providence Portland Regional Laboratory in Portland OR. Except for HER2 gene amplification detection by Dual ISH, ER, PR detection system, other reagentshave not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

A)  LEFT BREAST:  Received in formalin labeled [[PHI]] is a 456 gram product of a simple mastectomy procedure measuring 20 cm from superior to inferior, 15 cm from lateral to medial and 4 cm from anterior to posterior.  The specimen reveals an overlying horizontally oriented, 12.5 x 3.2 cm, tan skin ellipse lying within 3.5 cm of the inferior aspect of the specimen.  The skin ellipse reveals a central, 1.5 cm everted nipple.  There is a short suture on one longitudinal margin and a long suture on one apex, which are presumed to represent the superior and the lateral aspects of the specimen respectively per the requisition form. 

The superior and inferior superficial margins are inked orange and green respectively;  the deep margin is inked black.  

Sectioning reveals abundant fibrous densities most highly concentrated in the central and lateral aspects of the specimen with no grossly recognizable evidence of tumor involvement.  The cut surfaces of the fibrous component are diffusely cystic.  No suspected tumor is identified and no lymph nodes are retrieved from the lateral aspect of the specimen.  Representative sections are submitted.

RIGHT COLON WITH APPENDIX:  Received in formalin, labeled [[PHI]], is a previously partially opened partial ileal colon, having an attached vermiform appendix.  The specimen has a length of 38 cm.  The small intestinal component accounts for 8 cm of the length of the specimen, and has a diameter of 2 cm.  The colonic component accounts for 30 cm of the length of the specimen and has a diameter that varies from 5 to 3.5 cm.  Both margins are surgically stapled.  The proximal aspect of the colonic component reveals induration.

The ileum has a wall thickness of 0.3 cm and a grossly unremarkable mucosa.  

The intact vermiform appendix has a length of 7.5 cm and a maximum diameter of 0.9 cm.  Its wall averages 0.2 cm in thickness, and its mucosa appears unremarkable.  

The colonic component has a wall thickness varying from 0.2 to 0.5 cm.  Most closely approximating the proximal margin by 8 cm, the distal margin by 20 cm, and the radial margin by 7 cm is a peripherally fungating, centrally ulcerated, nearly circumferential 11 x 7 cm tumor, which is sectioned to reveal a maximum radial thickness of 3 cm.  The tumor appears to violate the wall at the mesenteric aspect of the specimen; the tumor most closely approximates the inked overlying serosa by 0.3 cm.  No tumor is identified on the serosal surface.  The remaining colonic mucosa appears unremarkable; representative sections are submitted.

p63 -- negative, no evidence of myoepithelial cells
CD10 -- negative, no evidence of myoepithelial cells
D2-40 -- negative, no evidence of myoepithelial cells
SMMHC -- positive staining in vessels, myofibroblast in stroma surrounding nests of carcinoma, scattered tumor cells 

Interpretation:  3 myoepithelial cell markers, p63, CD10 and D2 40 immunostain, performed show no evidence of myoepithelial cells surrounding the nests of neoplastic cells. SMMHC, in addition to staining the vessels, shows staining at the periphery of some of the nests of tumor. Considering the negativity for the 3 additional myoepithelial cell markers, and pattern of staining seen, the staining for SMMHC is favored to represent myofibroblasts or small vessels or tumor cells and not true myoepithelial cells.  Therefore the findings are consistent with invasive carcinoma.  A possible papillary component may be present.

Appropriate controls were used for each immunohistochemical stain.

LYMPH NODE NEEDLE CORE BIOPSY:  Sections show core biopsies which appear partially degenerated.  However, the cores are largely occupied by nodular clusters and sheets of epithelioid cells with moderate eosinophilic cytoplasm surrounding small- to intermediate-sized nuclei with occasional basophilic nucleoli.  Multiple immunohistochemical stains are performed to further characterize these cells including keratin-OSCAR, CAM 5.2, keratin-7, keratin-20, PLAP, CDX2, TTF-1, PSA, PSAP, P504S, synaptophysin, chromogranin and inhibin.  These show tumor cells to be positive for keratin-OSCAR and CAM 5.2, with weak expression of PSA and PSAP.  The remaining markers appear negative.

HER2 gene status (Ventana Medical Systems [Ventana] INFORM HER2 Dual ISH DNA Probe Cocktail) is reported as a function of the ratio of the average number of HER2 gene copies to the average number of Chr17 copies in nuclei of cells within an invasive breast carcinoma.  HER2 gene status is classified as non-amplified (HER2/Chr17 ratio < 2.0) or amplified (HER2/Chr17 ratio  2.0).  The method of scoring is based on 2013 ASCO/CAP Recommendations for HER2 Testing in Breast Cancer.

Methods:  HER2 (ERBB2) gene amplification was assessed utilizing the FDA approved Ventana HER2 INFORM Dual ISH DNA Probe Cocktail using two color chromogenic in situ in hybridization (ISH).  At least twenty non-overlapping nuclei containing at least one silver black (HER2) and one red (Chr17) signal were enumerated.  The ratio of black signals (HER2) to red signals (Chr17) was calculated. HER2 gene status (Ventana Medical Systems (Ventana) INFORM HER2 Dual ISH DNA Probe Cocktail) was reported as a function of the ratio of the average number of HER2 gene copies to the average number of Chr17 copies in nuclei of cells within an invasive breast carcinoma.  HER2 gene status was then classified as non-amplified (HER2/Chr17 ratio < 2.0) or amplified (HER2/Chr17 ratio  2.0).Immunohistochemistry was performed using sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue and multmer diaminobenzidine (DAB) based system on a Ventana BenchMark XT/Ultra automated slide stainer.  Whenapplicablethe immunohistochemistry was quantified using a Leica SCN-400 digital whole slide scanning system and the Definiens Architect/Tissue Studio image analysis software.  All digital image analysis results were reviewed and correlated with the morphological findings by a board certified pathologist.

The test has been developed, validated, performed, and its performance characteristics determined by Providence Portland Regional Laboratory in Portland OR. Except for HER2 gene amplification detection by Dual ISH, ER, PR detection system, other reagentshave not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary.  The test is for clinical purposes.  It should not be regarded as investigational or for research.  This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing.

HER2 gene status (Ventana Medical Systems [Ventana] INFORM HER2 Dual ISH DNA Probe Cocktail) is reported as a function of the ratio of the average number of HER2 gene copies to the average number of Chr17 copies in nuclei of cells within an invasive breast carcinoma.  HER2 gene status is classified as non-amplified (HER2/Chr17 ratio < 2.0) or amplified (HER2/Chr17 ratio  2.0).  The method of scoring is based on 2013 ASCO/CAP Recommendations for HER2 Testing in Breast Cancer.

Methods:  HER2 (ERBB2) gene amplification was assessed utilizing the FDA approved Ventana HER2 INFORM Dual ISH DNA Probe Cocktail using two color chromogenic in situ in hybridization (ISH).  At least twenty non-overlapping nuclei containing at least one silver black (HER2) and one red (Chr17) signal were enumerated.  The ratio of black signals (HER2) to red signals (Chr17) was calculated. HER2 gene status (Ventana Medical Systems (Ventana) INFORM HER2 Dual ISH DNA Probe Cocktail) was reported as a function of the ratio of the average number of HER2 gene copies to the average number of Chr17 copies in nuclei of cells within an invasive breast carcinoma.  HER2 gene status was then classified as non-amplified (HER2/Chr17 ratio < 2.0) or amplified (HER2/Chr17 ratio  2.0).Immunohistochemistry was performed using sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue and multmer diaminobenzidine (DAB) based system on a Ventana BenchMark XT/Ultra automated slide stainer.  Whenapplicablethe immunohistochemistry was quantified using a Leica SCN-400 digital whole slide scanning system and the Definiens Architect/Tissue Studio image analysis software.  All digital image analysis results were reviewed and correlated with the morphological findings by a board certified pathologist.

The test has been developed, validated, performed, and its performance characteristics determined by Providence Portland Regional Laboratory in Portland OR. Except for HER2 gene amplification detection by Dual ISH, ER, PR detection system, other reagentshave not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary.  The test is for clinical purposes.  It should not be regarded as investigational or for research.  This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing.

ADDENDUM:

Breast –  Hormone Receptors:

WS-15-9905: 20 mm invasive carcinoma
Estrogen Receptor: Positive: (2% of tumor cells, weak nuclear intensity)
Progesterone Receptor: Negative
Block: C9 

Estrogen Receptor: Negative: (<1%)
Progesterone Receptor: Negative
Block: C10 

ER and PR immunostains are performed in the 20 mm invasive carcinoma into different blocks, C9 and CD10.  There is nonspecific cytoplasmic staining the tumor with only minimal nuclear staining in approximately 2% of tumor cells in blocks C9 and in less than 1% in block C 10.  ER performed in the core biopsy specimen WS 15–98, showed moderate nuclear staining in approximately 18% of tumor cells, this difference as consistent with heterogeneity within the tumor.

- One lymph node with therapy-effect changes but without viable carcinoma.
- Four lymph nodes without viable carcinoma or therapy-effect changes.
- Focal extranodal tumor extension associated with one lymph node containing viable metastatic adenocarcinoma.

COMMENT:  The patient's prior history is reviewed on the Providence Portland Service Area Pathology Department electronic medical record.  No prior history is found on this review.

The patient's clinical history is also reviewed on Epic electronic medical record.  The patient's recent history and physical describes a 4 cm left lateral rectal tumor identified in November 2015, which was reported to be invasive adenocarcinoma on biopsy.  It is presumed that this prior biopsy was performed at an outside institution.  Subsequent to the prior biopsy and prior to the current case, the patient is reported to have undergone chemoradiation therapy with reported excellent clinical response to this therapy.

In the current case, residual malignancy is not identified in the sections from the rectal segmental resection specimen, including in the area identified as being of clinical interest by the surgeon.  Histologic sections from the area of clinical interest in the rectum show areas of fibrosis and patchy mild chronic inflammation in the submucosal component, which in this clinical setting may represent changes related to the prior therapy.

Twelve lymph nodes are identified in the part B rectal segmental resection specimen, all of which are negative for malignancy.  Four lymph nodes are identified in the part C right inguinal lymph node resection specimen, all of which are negative for malignancy.  In the part D left inguinal lymph node resection specimen, eight lymph nodes are identified; three of these lymph nodes show viable metastatic adenocarcinoma and therapy-effect changes, one lymph node shows therapy-effect changes without viable metastatic carcinoma, and four lymph nodes are without viable metastatic carcinoma or therapy-effect changes.

Based on the above, the current case is classified as ypT0, ypN1b, MX.

"
405,14,ES-72,Diagnosis,"
A.  SKIN, RIGHT UPPER BACK, PUNCH BIOPSY:
-Focally acanthotic epidermis with focal acantholysis, occasional dyskeratotic keratinocytes, and focal exocytosis of lymphocytes.
-Underlying mild superficial perivascular and interstitial chronic inflammation including scattered eosinophils.
-See comment.
Comment (A):  Dr. Obadiah's progress note in Epic is reviewed, and multiple level tissue sections were evaluated.  This is a difficult case as the two biopsies reveal somewhat different histologic findings.

Multiple level tissue sections were evaluated from this right upper back specimen.  The findings in this specimen would be compatible with a transient acantholytic dyskeratosis (Grover's disease).  The eosinophils that are present within the underlying superficial dermis are a relatively common finding in Grover's disease, and would not favor an arthropod bite reaction.  Furthermore, most insect bite reactions contain inflammatory cells within the deep dermis, as well as superficially.   This is in contrast to this current specimen in which the inflammation is nearly entirely present within the superficial dermis.   There is no evidence of folliculitis, and typical histologic features of granuloma Annulare are not identified.  A PAS stain was performed and is negative for fungal organisms.

B.  SKIN, RIGHT MID BACK, PUNCH BIOPSY:
-Epidermal acanthosis with minimal hyperkeratosis, focal spongiosis, and focal exocytosis of lymphocytes.
- Underlying papillary and reticular dermis with patchy perivascular and interstitial chronic lymphohistiocytic inflammation including scattered eosinophils with focal extravasated red blood cells.
-See comment.

Comment (B):  Multiple level tissue sections were evaluated through the entire biopsy.  In contrast to  the right upper back specimen, this specimen only reveals a thickened epidermis with minimal hyperkeratosis that is devoid of both acantholysis and dyskeratosis.  The epidermis change is not typical of lichen simplex chronicus, as hypergranulosis -- invariably present in LSC -- is not seen.  While the epidermal change somewhat resembles a tiny seborrheic keratosis, it may represent a non-specific hyperplasia.  In addition, the underlying dermis contains a granuloma Annulare-like infiltrate that is comprised of patchy aggregates of histiocytes with perivascular lymphocytes and scattered eosinophils.  Typical histologic features of Grover's disease are not present, and the rare spongiotic variant of Grover's disease is not favored.  This could represent an insect bite reaction or possibly papular granuloma Annulare.  The cause of the latter condition is not known, although rarely both insect bites and trauma have been implicated as possible inciting factors.  There is no evidence of folliculitis, and a PAS stain is negative for fungal organisms.

"
407,14,ES-72,Microscopic Description,"
A.  RIGHT UPPER BACK:  Multiple (9) level tissue sections are evaluated.  The sections reveal a centrally acanthotic epidermis with reactive changes, focal acantholysis, and focal exocytosis of lymphocytes.  Occasional dyskeratotic keratinocytes, mostly in the form of corp grains, are also seen in this area, mostly within the cornified layer.  A mild superficial perivascular and focal interstitial chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate that includes occasional eosinophils is present within the underlying papillary dermis.  The deep dermis is unremarkable, and is not involved by this process.  There is no evidence of a folliculitis.  A PAS stain was performed and is negative for fungal organisms.  The PAS-positive control tissue stained appropriately. 

B.  RIGHT MID BACK:  Multiple (18) level tissue sections are evaluated through the entire biopsy.  The sections reveal an acanthotic and focally spongiotic epidermis with focal exocytosis of lymphocytes.  The cornified layer is minimally hyperkeratotic with focal parakeratosis.  No acantholytic and/or dyskeratotic keratinocytes are identified.  A mild to moderately dense superficial and focal deep perivascular and interstitial chronic lymphohistiocytic inflammatory cell infiltrate is present within the underlying dermis.   The lymphocytes have a tendency to surround blood vessels, while the histiocytes have more of a predilection to intercalate between hyalinized, mildly degenerative collagen.  Extravasated red blood cells and scattered eosinophils are also seen within the dermis.  No pathogenic organisms are identified.  There is no evidence of vasculitis or folliculitis.   A PAS stain was performed and is negative for fungal organisms.  The PAS-positive control tissue stained appropriately.
